The following section provides example R code for calculating the Dynamic Relative Benthic Status (dRBS). This code offers guidance on how to model the depletion and recovery of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VME) indicator taxa following bottom trawling activities in New Zealand waters. The dRBS was computed for 10 VME indicator taxa using spatial estimates of abundance and 30-year spatial distributions of annual bottom trawling intensity. VME distributions were modelled using environmental predictors under both present and future climate scenarios. The results of this work are presented in the manuscript “Bottom trawling affects the viability of climate refugia for vulnerable marine ecosystem indicator taxa” avaliable  on line: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569125002303
